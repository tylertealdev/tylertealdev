Dear Mojang Team,

I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for my recent actions regarding the unauthorized use of your intellectual property on this platform. I recognize that what I did was not only inappropriate but also disrespectful to the hard work and creativity that you and your team have invested in your games.

I understand the importance of intellectual property rights and the impact that such infringements can have on your company and the community as a whole. I deeply regret any harm my actions may have caused.

Moving forward, I am committed to respecting your rights and will ensure that my future contributions to the community align with the values of creativity and respect for original work.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best,
